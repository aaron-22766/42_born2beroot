## ðŸ—£ About

This document is a System Administration related exercise. This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

## ðŸ—’ Notice

Everything I learned in this project, I documented in [evalknowledge.md](https://github.com/aaron-22766/42_born2beroot/blob/main/evalknowledge.md).
The script that was set up to run from the cron job and prints different information about the maching is [monitoring.sh](https://github.com/aaron-22766/42_born2beroot/blob/main/monitoring.sh).
